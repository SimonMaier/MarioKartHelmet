# IMU-Joystick

**An easy-to-build DIY game controller for computers, based on the MPU6050 gyroscope & Arduino Pro Micro.** 

:video_game:

## Features

The IMU-Joystick is assembled in less than 15 minutes and costs about €5 (including the breadboard).
When connected to a computer the board presents itself as a USB joystick. Using the MPU6050, the Pro Micro measures acceleration & rotation data and maps it to joystick behaviour. The number of joystick axes and buttons and the precise mapping can be configured in the Arduino sketches. The controller is automatically detected as a generic joystick device on Linux, Mac, and Windows, without further software:

## Example Usage

For some simple applications check out the [/examples/](/examples)  folder. 
  - `examples/MarioKartHelmet/` demonstrates how to configure IMU-Joystick as a head-mounted game controller, intended for *Mario Kart 64* or *Mario Kart Double Dash*. It allows karts to be controlled through head movements and items triggered via jumping. After a lot of playing, we can assure that it brings a immersive game experience to what is already a great party game :tada:.
  - `examples/BasicHeadTracker` sets up a generic Joystick with 2 axes and a physical calibration button. It works out of the box  with many games. Here you can watch a video of someone collecting 89 herrings in `extremetuxracer`, using an IMU-Joystick with the `BasicHeadTracker` sketch, mounted on a headset:

## How to build an IMU-Joystick

You can build your own IMU-Joystick in about 1-2h, just follow the instructions below. Except for mounting pin headers, no soldering is required.

### 1. Get the hardware
  - [Arduino(-compatible) Pro Micro](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/New-Pro-Micro-for-arduino-ATmega32U4-5V-16MHz-Module-with-2-row-pin-header-For-Leonardo/32773740303.html), any ATmega32U4-based Arduino will do.
  - [MPU6050](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/versandkostenfrei-gy-521-mpu-6050-mpu6050-modul-3-achse-analog-Gyro-Sensoren-beschleunigungsmesser-modul/32315092057.html) (GY-521 breakout), a low-cost accelerometer + gyroscope.
  - mini-sized [breadboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Mini-Breadboard-Protoboard-DIY-Kit-Universal-Transparent-Solderless-SYB-170-Breadboard-170Tie-points-Prototype-Boards-35X47MM/32717999019.html)
  - (optional) [push buttons](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/100pcs-6-6-5mm-4pin-Quality-Mini-Micro-Momentary-Tactile-Push-Button-Switch/32753141267.html)
  - some wire to make breadboard connections.

**Total material cost** as of June 2017: €2,72 Pro Micro + €0.93 GY-521 + €0.80 breadboard = **4.45€**, shipping included.

### 2. Assemble the hardware
Solder pin headers where needed; Place Pro Micro, GY-521 & wire on breadboard as follows:

</p>
Note that Pro Micro `Pin  8` and `Pin 9` do not need to connect to the MPU6050.

### 3. Get the software
- [Arduino IDE (>=1.6.6)](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
- external Arduino libraries:
  - [i2cdevlib](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib)
    collection (at least [I2Cdev](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/I2Cdev) and [MPU6050](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050)).
    Follow the [installation instructions on the website](https://www.i2cdevlib.com/usage), or copy the folders `i2cdevlib/Arduino/I2Cdev` and `i2cdevlib/Arduino/MPU6050` from the project repository into your Arduino [libraries directory](https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries) (`~/Arduino/libraries/` on Linux).
  - [ArduinoJoystickLibrary (>=2.0)](https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary)
    Copy the folder `ArduinoJoystickLibrary/Joystick` to your Arduino libraries directory.
- our Arduino sketches.
    
### 4. Upload the software

Install the required libraries and upload the one of the example sketches to your Pro Micro board. Note that you might need to select Arduino Leonardo as a target board, when using the Arduino GUI.

### 5. Enjoy!

We recommend that you play some *Mario Kart 64* with your IMU Joystick used as a head tracker (on ArchLinux).
Do the following steps:
  - Step 0: Upload the [MarioKartHelmet](examples/MarioKartHelmet/MarioKartHelmet.ino) sketch
  - Step 1: `~# pacman -S mupen64plus`
  - Step 2: Add controller specification to `/usr/share/mupen64plus/InputAutoCfg.ini` file.
  - Step 3: Legally obtain ROM file for *Mario Kart 64*.
  - Step 4: Connect controller & carefully place it on top of your head
  - Step 5: `~# mupen64plus --fullscreen --gfx mupen64plus-video-glide64 <location-of-ROM-file.n64>`
  - Step 6: \o/ Control race cars using your head movements.

## How to *develop* the controller

This section lists some tools, that we found useful during development.

  - the linux command line tool package `joyutils` allow testing and simple debugging of joysticks, e.g. with `~$ jstest /dev/input/js0`. A graphical version [jstest-gtk](https://github.com/Grumbel/jstest-gtk) is also available.
  - the N64 emulator `mupen64plus` is useful to evaluate gameplay experience. Alternatively, the free game `extremetuxracer` also has Joystick support.
